# Python Playground
This is a home for some python practicle examples and the exercises I followed, in the start of the journey towards learning of Python language.

And also I hope this will grow with the time during my journey of learning and mastering Python further, in future, since I'm planning to use this same repo as the playground.

`Note: In pdf files in the root directory you can always find the learning notes, slides or other written guides for Python language`

## Tutorial 1
In this directory you can find the general Python examples, it's kind of mix of attempted practicals of general Python keywords, language structure, loops, conditional blocks and useful built-in functions etc.

## Tutorial 2
In this directory you can find the attemted practicals for understanding conditional statements of Python language.

## Tutorial 3
In this directory you can find the attemted practicals for understanding loops or iterative statements of Python language.
